      Welcome to Cash Flow PA
    %p
      Pennsylvania's Department of State maintains a
      %a{:href => "https://www.campaignfinanceonline.pa.gov/Pages/CampaignFinanceHome.aspx"}public record
      of almost 140,000 campaign finance reports. Keeping this data is important to operating an efficient, functional government, but making sense of it can take a lot of time and effort.
    %p
      Cash Flow PA makes Pennsylvania’s campaign finance data easier for you to read and interpret by organizing all available transactions and filers, fetching the reports based on a location you provide, and presenting the data to you in an easily digestible format.
